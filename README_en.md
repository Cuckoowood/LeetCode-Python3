## Introduction
"LeetCode-Python3 Notes" is a solution to my problem on LeetCode. It is written in Python3 for personal reference and learning and communication.
## How To Solve The Problem
> Not because of hope, but because of persistence.

**First of all, if we have no ideas, it is most likely because we have insufficient input.** Many questions require specific methods to solve. For example, in a problem of the weekly competition, the method of union and collection is used, and I don't even know what the union and collection are, so it is almost impossible to make the problem even if I think about it. Therefore, you can't figure out a solution to the problem at first, you can learn the answer first.

**Secondly, it is best to sort the questions in the order of easy to difficult and break through.** Here is a reference to the ["LeetCode Classification Order Table"](https://cspiration.com/leetcodeClassification) summarized by Great God Cspiration. Classification brushing questions can help us to conduct targeted training and form our own way of thinking for specific problem types.

**Finally, do more important topics**. It is difficult to really master many problems when we do it again. When we do it the second time, try to complete it independently, analyze the time complexity and space complexity, and finally compare the solutions of others to see if there is a more optimized solution.
